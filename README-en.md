# 2RTK NTRIP Caster v2.2.0

**Language / Language Selection:**

---

This is a simple NTRIP caster written in Python that supports NTRIP v1.0 and v2.0 protocols, managed through a web interface.
You can use the web interface to add users and mount points in your browser, and also view the NTRIP caster connection information.
It supports high concurrent connections and can handle 2000+ concurrent connections. (Due to my limited testing environment, I only tested with 2 RTCM data sources and 2000 concurrent user downloads, but its performance is excellent)

It used to be a single file 2rtk.py,https://github.com/Rampump/2RTKcaster   . but I recently refactored it. Now it looks much fatter, but I still think it's relatively lightweight. lol

- Web-based management. So you can deploy it on any cloud host.
- Uses SQLite database to store user information and mount point information.
- Leverages the pyrtcm library to parse uploaded data and correct STR tables (this part of the code has been rewritten several times, but I'm still not satisfied with it, including the current version. Looking forward to future updates).
    (You just need to add a mount point on the web page and upload RTCM data, 2rtk-NtripCaster will automatically generate STR information and parse RTCM data to extract data types and location information to correct the STR)
- This NTRIP caster is still far from the caster in my mind. I will gradually improve it in my spare time.
- It supports most systems with Python environment, including debian, ubuntu, centos, armbian, etc.
- Supports Docker deployment.

## Installation Tutorials

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)

## Frontend Web Interface Features
### Homepage
You can see the current caster's running status on the homepage, including connection count, user count, mount point count, etc. The log information below will push user or mount point connection status in real-time. DEBUG mode will push more debugging information.

### User Management Page
You can add users, delete users, modify user passwords, etc. on the user management page. You can also see online users. (User management will be added later, API is reserved)

### Mount Point Management Page
You can add mount points, delete mount points, modify mount point information, etc. on the mount point management page. You can also see online information. (Mount point management will be added later, API is reserved)

### Base Station Information Page
You can view RTCM status on the base station information page. Click the INFO button in front of the STR entry, and the backend will parse it and display it in the information below. (This usually takes some time to parse before updating the display)

## Configuration Guide

### Main Configuration Options

```ini
[ntrip]
port = 2101                    # NTRIP service port
max_connections = 5000         # Maximum connections

[web] 
port = 5757                    # Web management port
refresh_interval = 10          # Data refresh interval

[performance]
thread_pool_size = 5000        # Concurrent connection thread pool size
max_workers = 5000             # Maximum worker threads
ring_buffer_size = 60          # Ring buffer size

[security]
secret_key = your-secret-key   # Please change the default key in production
```

```ini
[admin]
username = admin               # Administrator username
password = admin123            # Administrator password (change in production)
```

### Common Issue Diagnosis

#### Port Occupation Issues
```bash
# Check port occupation
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :2101    # NTRIP port
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :5757    # Web management port
sudo lsof -i :2101                 # Check port usage

# Release port
sudo kill -9 <PID>                 # Force terminate process
sudo fuser -k 2101/tcp             # Force release port
```

#### Network Connection Issues
```bash
# Firewall check
sudo ufw status                    # Ubuntu firewall
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all       # CentOS firewall

# Open ports
sudo ufw allow 2101/tcp            # NTRIP port
sudo ufw allow 5757/tcp            # Web management port

# Network connectivity test
telnet localhost 2101              # Test NTRIP port
curl http://localhost:5757/        # Test Web port
```

### Performance Optimization

#### High Concurrency Configuration
```ini
# config.ini optimization configuration
[ntrip]
max_connections = 10000            # Maximum connections
port = 2101

[performance]
thread_pool_size = 10000           # Thread pool size
max_workers = 10000                # Maximum worker threads
ring_buffer_size = 60              # Ring buffer

[network]
buffer_size = 16384                # Network buffer
timeout = 30                       # Connection timeout
```

#### System-level Optimization
```bash
# Increase file descriptor limit
echo "* soft nofile 65536" >> /etc/security/limits.conf
echo "* hard nofile 65536" >> /etc/security/limits.conf

# Network parameter optimization
echo "net.core.somaxconn = 65536" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
echo "net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 65536" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p
```

### Monitoring and Logging

#### Log Level Configuration
```ini
# config.ini log configuration
[logging]
level = INFO                       # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
format = json                      # json, text
rotate_size = 100MB               # Log rotation size
rotate_count = 10                 # Number of log files to keep
```
